# Javascript-Projects
These are some small projects and assignments I completed throughout the JavaScript course of my bootcamp!

Projects:
- Pizza Menu
- Tic-Tac-Toe Game
- Calculator
- To Do App

**Pizza Menu:**
  
  This project contains a menu used to order pizza with different toppings; it then takes the input   information and calculates a price for the order!
  
**Tic-Tac-Toe Game:**
  
  This game project will randomly roll dice to select which of the two players goes first; users can 
  also decide which token each player wants to use.
  
**Calculator:**
  
  A basic 4 function calculator! Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web         version of a calculator.
  
**To-Do App:**
  
  This project allows users to type in their own to do tasks and then simply press the "x" 
  beside each task as its completed to remove it from the array!
